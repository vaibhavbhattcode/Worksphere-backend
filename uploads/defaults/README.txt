Place default avatar images here:
- userprofile.jpg (recommended 512x512, square, subtle neutral silhouette)
- companyprofile.png (recommended 512x512, square, simple building or abstract logo)

These are served statically via /uploads/defaults/... as long as server.js mounts /uploads.
Make sure filenames match exactly the defaults set in UserProfile and CompanyProfile models.
